# Tindog Bootstrap Project
The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp, Sections 6 and 7: Introductory and Intermediate Bootstrap 4 - Dr. Angela Yu

5-18-22: I have completed section 6 of this project, which involved styling a given template using Bootstrap.  I will definitely circle back to work on section 7 soon!

## Overview
This project gave me the chance to assess how much I have learned, as this is my second Bootstrap course.  The Bootstrap challenges were just right for my level.  I am developing a love/hate relationship with Bootstrap, though.  I love the effects, but I hate that the grid is so heavy on HTML styling with its numerous Bootstrap classes. The more rows I create, the more time-consuming (and buggy) it is to make the individual adjustments.  Maybe, with more experience, I'll have a better idea of what I want beforehand.  Overall, this is a very nice and engaging course.  It has just the right balance of lecture and hands-on practice.

## My process
5-18-22 I started out learning how to create a Bootstrap nav bar that transforms into a responsive toggler (the three-lined "hamburger" menu that appears on mobile devices).  While performing this task, I clearly saw growth in myself.  When I had tried to add a toggler to my loc-journey website after my first Bootstrap class about a month ago, I had difficulty finding guidance.  For some reason, I did not thoroughly check the Bootstrap documentation.  I found information on W3Schools, but the directions did not work for me.  I assumed that it was because the directions were for Bootstrap 3 while I was working with Bootstrap 5.  I also assumed that it had something to do with JQuery, which was not included with Bootstrap 5.  Upon reflection, I now suspect that my problem, similarly to several other problems that I had styling that site, was a result of browser defaults.  

One thing I've learned about Bootstrap the hard way--it's easier to start off designing a website with Bootstrap from the very beginning than it is to restyle a website with Bootstrap later.  It really helped to be guided through the Bootstrap documentation by Dr.Yu.  I came to realize that by perusing the documentation, and really taking time to read and comprehend it, eventually, I will find answers.  

After creating the entire navbar in codeply, I copied and pasted it into an html template provided by Dr. Yu.  The template included pictures and text planned for a Tindog website, a mock up of Tinder.  I styled the title section mostly with the support of Dr. Yu.  Another revelation of growth--I gained a better understanding of how to effecively use Font Awesome to add icons.  My first exposure to Font Awesome was not so awesome because I didn't yet understand how to style the icons or to use them creatively.  Placing appropriate icons on the download buttons, controlling styling, and using the pseudo-class `:hover`demonstrated a broader range of possibilities. The biggest independent challenge I was assigned was to style the nav bar elements, the h1, the pararagraph, and the picture to resemble a completed example.  I was able to style mine to look very similar, but mostly, I had chosen different ways to space and position.  For example, I used padding in places where Dr. Yu used margins.  I was spot-on sizing and rotating the image.  I did research to help me recall how to do the rotation.

The final challenge of Section 6 was to style the features section independently, according to given specifications.  I used a grid within a fluid container to position my divs and to make the feature section responsive.  I was surprised that Dr. Yu had not used a fluid container, but padding.  I also hadn't noticed the effect of spacing the divs, so my result did not actually look as similar to the completed example as I had thought it did.  I was really pleased with my work, and felt a great sense of accomplishment in finishing this portion of the Tindog project! 

### Built with

- Bootstrap 5 classes 
- CSS 3 properties

### What I learned

- how to navigate the bootstrap documentation  
- how to use codeply
- how to add a navbar with a toggler (hamburger menu)
- how to create a fluid container
- how to implement and style Bootstrap classes
- a review of Bootstrap grid
- a review of Font Awesome icons
- how to style Font Awesome icons
- a review of documenting code with comments

```
Note: While completing this READ ME, I learned more about creating tables in Markdown in order to place my images side by side in the Screenshots section. 

```

### Continued development
I look forward to completing Section 7, and learning Bootstrap at an intermediate level as I finish up my Tindog landing page.  My learning plan is to first learn more Python, JavaScript, Data Structures and Algorithms, complete a couple of Python and JavaScript projects, and learn React.  I'll come back to HTML and CSS/Bootstrap once that is accomplished, or perhaps I will take breaks from my learning plan now and then to continue working on this and other HTML and CSS/Bootstrap projects, including the very first website that I built--it still needs a Bootstrap navbar!
